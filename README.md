# fwi
FWI is a jQuery plugin for displaying pictures stored on Flickr on web page.

This is a port of the PWI library from Google Picasa to Flickr.

Google is removing the Picasa API and features, so I started to move my photos
to Flickr and create a library that has most of the features of PWI.

This version is still very alpha, I developed it for my own use and is still
lacking a lot of the features of PWI.

Included in this package is the Colorbox implementation, to make sure the
download is complete, and that the version used is compatible with FWI.
